# Rock_paper_scissors
let's make a Rock Paper Scissors game

first, I import the random procedure so our PC is unpredictable
import random

then, I make a set of moves the PC can choose from

Now to start coding the game

I would like to have this loop forever, so let's make a "switch" for the game (keep_playing = "true")

Now we loop the program based on that switch

have the computer (cmove) choose randomly from the set of moves above

then our player input

then what the computer chose

start defining the outcomes and every possible outcomes at once
